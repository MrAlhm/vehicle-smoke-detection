# Vehicle Smoke Detection System 🚗💨

An AI-based prototype to detect excessive vehicular smoke from traffic camera images using computer vision.

## Problem
Urban air pollution is significantly increased by high-emission vehicles. Manual roadside checks are inefficient and not scalable.

## Solution
This system analyzes vehicle images (simulated CCTV frames) to:
- Detect excessive smoke emissions
- Classify vehicles as normal or polluting
- Generate digital evidence for enforcement

## Features
- Image-based smoke detection
- Real-time emission classification
- Professional web interface using Streamlit

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and supports uploading vehicle images for live analysis.
